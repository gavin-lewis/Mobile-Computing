# Network Simulation
This repostitory contains code for basic network simulation to demonstrate the understanding of NS2.
This code was created for learning NS2 tool.
The NS2 tool is used to simulate networks.

## Programs:
1. hidden_terminal.tcl : This simulation shows the hidden terminal problem in GSM.
2. exposed_terminal.tcl : This simulation shows the exposed terminal problem in GSM.
3. adhoc_network.tcl : This simulation shows the packet flow in an ad-hoc network.
4. infrasturucture_network.tcl : This simulation shows the packet flow in an infrastructure based network.

## Installation of  NS2 on Ubuntu to run the code
1. Run the command: sudo apt install ns
2. Run the command: sudo apt install nam
3. Run the command: ns file_name.tcl
